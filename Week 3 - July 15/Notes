1. The feature tree (ie. the 2Sat part) does not necessarily make the problem harder. Adding the tree can change the problem from easy to hard.
2. The interesting problems are where the 3Sat is hard but the 2Sat + 3Sat is easy and BOTH are satisfiable.

A. Hypothesis: there exists a 3Sat that is satisfiable and hard and adding the 2Sat tree is satisfiable and easy.
B. Run the real world models, and compare the runtime after dropping the 2Sat part.
